# Developing and Deploying Theatre Frontend

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
- `npm start`: To run the app in development mode. Opens at port localhost:3000.
- `npm test`: To launch the test runner.
- `npm run build`: To build the app for production in the `build` folder. After building, drag the **build** folder outside Theatre into the TheatreBackend **src/main/resources/static** folder. Drag contents of **build** outside into the static folder and delete the empty **build** folder.

## Deploying on Heroku

- After following the steps listed beside `npm run build`, push the new contents of TheatreBackend repo (make sure to be on master branch) to the TheatreBackend GitHub repository and go to the Heroku website to deploy there.
